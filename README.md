# Quantum Ethics

A web platform exploring the profound ethical implications of quantum computing and raising global awareness about the transformative power of this emerging technology.

## About

This project examines a critical question: **What if a private individual owned the world's first fully functional quantum computer?** Through interactive content, visual demonstrations, and expert insights, we explore the potential risks, ethical challenges, and necessary safeguards surrounding quantum computing.

The site features:
- Clear explanations of quantum computing fundamentals
- Visual demonstrations of potential misuse scenarios
- A Quantum Bill of Rights outlining essential protections
- Expert insights on quantum security and ethics
- Comprehensive references and citations
